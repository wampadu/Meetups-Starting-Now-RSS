consequences of Plato's philosophy, a necessary corrective to the more visionary and utopian *Republic*. In this animated encounter between an Athenian, Spartan, and Cretan, not only do we see reflected, in Plato's own thought, eternal questions of the relation between political theory and practice, but we also witness the working out of a detailed plan for a new \"second best\" political order that embodies the results of Plato's mature reflections on moral psychology, ethics, the family, the status of women, property rights, criminal law, the role of religion, music, and the fine arts, and other topics. The core ideas of the *Laws* — a mixed constitution, the rule of law, citizen participation, and education as the foundation of good governance — continue to resonate with political theory and practice today.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nWe'll be continuing from Book X, 900c (the previous meeting started at Book X, 897b).\n\nThe dramatic action is as follows: Three elders—an Athenian, a Spartan, and a Cretan—walk the path of Minos and discuss laws and law-giving.\n\nNo particular edition is required but we can discuss what we want to use during the meeting.

When we refresh our minds and break free of those patterns, we find that we have the wisdom and ability to make the necessary changes to succeed.\n\n\\*\\*RSVP here :\nhttps://www.onlinemeditationevents.com/class/success-meditation/","startDate":"2026-02-28T21:00:00.000Z","endDate":"","eventStatus":"https://schema.org/EventScheduled","image":"/images/fallbacks/redesign/group-cover-4-square.webp","eventAttendanceMode":"https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode","location":{"@type":"VirtualLocation","url":"https://www.meetup.com/plainviewmeditation/events/313270715/"},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plainview Meditation","url":"https://www.meetup.com/plainviewmeditation/"},"performer":"Plainview Meditation"},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Let's Code Together!","url":"https://www.meetup.com/girls-coding-club/events/312902315/","description":"Hi!\n\nPlease join us in working together this Saturday afternoon.

I think you'll really like Chakradance!\n\nChakradance is a gentle way, like Reiki, to release stress and restore your energy.\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to meditate while your mind is racing… you know how difficult it can be.\n\nThat’s because stress and emotion don’t just live in the mind — they live in the **body** and the **energy field**.\n\nAnd sometimes the gentle way to heal is to **move** that energy rather than sit with it.\n\nThat’s why I’m so excited to invite you again to the **7 Day Chakradance™ Challenge** — created and guided live by Natalie, founder of Chakradance™.\n\nFor 7 days, she’ll take us through a live journey of movement, meditation, mandala art, and chakra healing.\n\nEyes closed, no “dance steps,” fully guided — just you, your breath, and the music.\n\nAs a Licensed Chakradance™ Facilitator I know how powerful this modality is. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have experienced emotional release, renewed clarity, and deep inner peace through these sessions.\n\n**Here’s our journey for the week:**\n🌺 **Day 1 — Base:** Grounding + calm\n🌊 **Day 2 — Sacral:** Flow + emotional ease\n🔥 **Day 3 — Solar Plexus:** Confidence + empowerment\n💚 **Day 4 — Heart:** Love + compassion\n💙 **Day 5 — Throat:** Expression + truth\n💜 **Day 6 — Third Eye:** Intuition + insight\n✨ **Day 7 — Crown:** Connection + inspiration\n\nReplays are available for a limited time — so you can follow at your own pace.\n\n**Here’s what you need to know:**\n📅 **Dates:** February 22 – 28th, 2026\n🕚 **Live time:** 1pm PT \\| 4pm ET \\| 9pm GMT \\| 7am AEST\n🎥 **Replays available** until March 3rd\n⏱ **What to expect**: A 60-minute guided session each day — eyes closed, no choreography, just you and the music\n💛 **Free to join** **\\| No experience needed**\n\nAnd when you register, you’ll receive the **Chakra Health Check** to help you understand where your energy most needs attention.\n\n👉 **Join the [Free 7 Day Chakradance Challenge](https://www.chakradance.com/7-day-chakradance-challenge/?cda=sacredmtnhealingyahoocom)**\n\nIf your system feels full… heavy… or out of sync, this might be exactly what you need to reconnect with yourself.\n\nWith love,\n**Tracy Cash, Reiki Master Teacher**\nCommunity Reiki Circle Organizer\n\nP.S.

We offer honest constructive critiques to help you identify the strengths and weaknesses in your writing. Critiques focus on character, plot, historical accuracy, weaponry, inconsistencies, setting, areas where you’re pulling a reader in or pushing them out of the story, and other elements. Our goal is to help you be the writer you want to be. Please be open to hearing the good and the bad because that’s how we all get better.\nTo help writers get published, we started a biannual anthology featuring member stories. We’re currently working on a way to highlight the individual works of our published authors.

– Laws, Book X (Live Reading)","description":"The *Laws*, Plato's longest dialogue, is a comprehensive presentation of the practical consequences of Plato's philosophy, a necessary corrective to the more visionary and utopian *Republic*. In this animated encounter between an Athenian, Spartan, and Cretan, not only do we see reflected, in Plato's own thought, eternal questions of the relation between political theory and practice, but we also witness the working out of a detailed plan for a new \"second best\" political order that embodies the results of Plato's mature reflections on moral psychology, ethics, the family, the status of women, property rights, criminal law, the role of religion, music, and the fine arts, and other topics. The core ideas of the *Laws* — a mixed constitution, the rule of law, citizen participation, and education as the foundation of good governance — continue to resonate with political theory and practice today.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nWe'll be continuing from Book X, 900c (the previous meeting started at Book X, 897b).\n\nThe dramatic action is as follows: Three elders—an Athenian, a Spartan, and a Cretan—walk the path of Minos and discuss laws and law-giving.\n\nNo particular edition is required but we can discuss what we want to use during the meeting. Because of this, sharing some editions generally available digitally in the comments may be helpful. I'll also try to keep the Greek text handy (probably through a Loeb edition, but anyone can look at Perseus as well).\n\nIf you want to familiarize yourself with the text in advance here are some different editions:\n\nOn Perseus, Shorely (HTML): https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0166\n\nPlato's Complete Works:\n\nPDF:

Stories Bootcamp (Creative Writing Workshop)","description":"**Stories that are true, about you, told in a few!**\n\nThis multi-week creative writing course focuses on the craft of short-form personal storytelling, with each story designed to be performed aloud in under ten minutes. You'll learn how to identify meaningful moments from your life and shape them into a compelling, well-structured dramatic narrative.\n\nSelect standout stories will be featured on our Voices Against Hate podcast.\n\nIn Week 1, you’ll hunt for meaningful moments and shape them into the “chapters” of your life. Week 2 focuses on drafting a complete personal story. In Week 3, you’ll share your work, receive feedback, and revise. The bootcamp culminates in a Week 4 showcase of polished personal stories.\n\n**What you'll take away from this workshop:**\n\n\\- A polished 10\\-minute true audio story drawn from your own life\\.\n\\- A supportive and safe community space to share your work\\.\n\\- The opportunity to become a better writer and gain fresh perspective on the experiences that shaped you\\.\n\n**About the Instructor**\n\n**Scarlet Chen** is an award-winning Chinese-Canadian screenwriter, playwright, director, and stand-up comic.

you know the importance of self-healing. I think you'll really like Chakradance!\n\nChakradance is a gentle way, like Reiki, to release stress and restore your energy.\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to meditate while your mind is racing… you know how difficult it can be.\n\nThat’s because stress and emotion don’t just live in the mind — they live in the **body** and the **energy field**.\n\nAnd sometimes the gentle way to heal is to **move** that energy rather than sit with it.\n\nThat’s why I’m so excited to invite you again to the **7 Day Chakradance™ Challenge** — created and guided live by Natalie, founder of Chakradance™.\n\nFor 7 days, she’ll take us through a live journey of movement, meditation, mandala art, and chakra healing.\n\nEyes closed, no “dance steps,” fully guided — just you, your breath, and the music.\n\nAs a Licensed Chakradance™ Facilitator I know how powerful this modality is. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have experienced emotional release, renewed clarity, and deep inner peace through these sessions.\n\n**Here’s our journey for the week:**\n🌺 **Day 1 — Base:** Grounding + calm\n🌊 **Day 2 — Sacral:** Flow + emotional ease\n🔥 **Day 3 — Solar Plexus:** Confidence + empowerment\n💚 **Day 4 — Heart:** Love + compassion\n💙 **Day 5 — Throat:** Expression + truth\n💜 **Day 6 — Third Eye:** Intuition + insight\n✨ **Day 7 — Crown:** Connection + inspiration\n\nReplays are available for a limited time — so you can follow at your own pace.\n\n**Here’s what you need to know:**\n📅 **Dates:** February 22 – 28th, 2026\n🕚 **Live time:** 1pm PT \\| 4pm ET \\| 9pm GMT \\| 7am AEST\n🎥 **Replays available** until March 3rd\n⏱ **What to expect**: A 60-minute guided session each day — eyes closed, no choreography, just you and the music\n💛 **Free to join** **\\| No experience needed**\n\nAnd when you register, you’ll receive the **Chakra Health Check** to help you understand where your energy most needs attention.\n\n👉 **Join the [Free 7 Day Chakradance Challenge](https://www.chakradance.com/7-day-chakradance-challenge/?cda=sacredmtnhealingyahoocom)**\n\nIf your system feels full… heavy… or out of sync, this might be exactly what you need to reconnect with yourself.\n\nWith love,\n**Tracy Cash, Reiki Master Teacher**\nCommunity Reiki Circle Organizer\n\nP.S. This is a beautiful chance to reset your energy with community, movement, and chakra healing.
